									another type of digital asset. We do not purchase or sell
									digital assets directly from or to users as principal. Our
									services do not provide users with the ability to trade one

									the right to submit digital currency trading instructions and
									complete digital currency trading through our Platforms. 2.1.2

									Platforms. 2.2 The user understands and agrees that our
									Platforms can adjust the service content, service type and
									service form on the Platforms at any time according to the
									actual situation at our sole discretion. Our Platforms are not
									responsible for any negative impact or loss caused to you or

									your country of residence, you may not be able to use all the
									functions of our Platforms. Without prejudice to our right of
									suspending certain services to users from a specific country,
									it is your responsibility to ensure that in accessing our

									information, non-personal information, and information
									provided by third parties (hereinafter collectively referred
									to as "user information"). Once the user registers, logs in,

									fully understand, agree and accept the reasonable use of the
									user information by the Company including but not limited to

									processes would be an explicit direction for our Platforms to
									conduct related transactions or operations for you. You agree
									that our Platforms have the right to deal with related matters
									in accordance with these Terms and/or relevant documents and
									rules in accordance with the relevant directions. 2.7 You are
									responsible for any disputes or losses caused by your failure
									to promptly modify or confirm the status of the transaction or
									failure to submit the relevant application. Our Platforms do
									not assume any responsibility. 3. Risks Disclosures and
									Acknowledgements 3.1 Perpetual Contract Risk Disclosures and
									Acknowledgements 3.1.1 Digital assets themselves are risky.
									The price of digital assets is prone to fluctuate, there is no
									limit for prices to go up and down, and there are unlimited
									transactions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week worldwide. Prices
									are easily affected by the control of the dealer and global
									news events, national policies, market demand and other
									factors. It may happen that prices rise several times a day,
									and prices may fall by half in one day. Due to the high
									leverage of the perpetual contract, you may suffer a large
									loss, so we strongly recommend that participate in trading
									within the risk range that you can afford. 3.1.2 Due to
									unexpected problems such as system failure, network reasons,
									denial-of-service attacks and other hacking attacks, abnormal
									transactions, market interruptions, or other possible abnormal
									conditions, we have the right to cancel the abnormal
									transaction results and roll back all the deals during a
									certain period of time according to the actual situation at
									our sole discretion without any liability whatsoever to you or
									any third party. 3.1.3 We strictly prohibit any unfair trading
									practices. We have the right to warn against all unscrupulous
									behaviors such as maliciously manipulating prices, maliciously
									affecting trading systems, and, when necessary, to restrict
									transactions, suspend transactions, cancel transactions,
									reverse closed transactions, freeze accounts, rollback time
									transactions, etc., to eliminate adverse effects at our sole
									discretion without any liability whatsoever to you or any
									third party. 3.1.4 When your position margin cannot meet the
									Platform’s requirements, your position will be forced to
									close. If the price fluctuates drastically and loss is
									incurred after using all risk control methods, we shall have
									the right to recover the loss from you. 3.1.5 When the number
									of positions or the number of orders is too large and we
									believe that there may be serious risks to the system and
									other users, you understand and agree that we have the right
									to ask you to take measures such as cancellation, closing and
									other risk control measures. In addition, when we deem it
									necessary, we have the right to control the risk of individual
									accounts by limiting the total number of positions, limiting
									the total number of orders, limiting the opening of positions,
									withdrawing orders or forcibly closing positions at our sole
									discretion without any liability whatsoever to you or any
									third party. 4. Transaction & Fees 4.1 Our Platforms will
									provide services for your transactions, and collect necessary
									services or management fees, in accordance with these Terms,
									relevant documents, agreements and/or relevant rules and
									instructions on our Platforms during the service process.
									Please refer to the relevant documents and the rules and
									descriptions of the relevant pages of our Platforms which are
									hereby expressly incorporated into these Terms and may be
									amended from time to time. 4.2You agree that our Platforms
									reserve the right to adjust the specific types and amounts of
									the aforementioned services or management fees from time to
									time and to make announcements and amendments in accordance
									with the Terms and related rules, and your continued access to
									our services constitutes your acceptance to the relevant rules
									in their latest forms. 5. Modification/Suspension/Termination
									of Service 5.1 These Terms shall remain in force unless
									unilaterally terminated by our Platforms or upon your
									application to terminate these Terms and with the consent of
									our Platforms. In the event that you violate these Terms,
									relevant rules, any laws or regulations, or we reasonably
									suspect that you are involved in illegal or inappropriate
									conduct in using our services, or at the request of government
									authorities, our Platforms reserve the right to, at our sole
									discretion and without any liability whatsoever to you,
									terminate these Terms, close your account, or restrict your
									use of our Platforms. However, our termination does not
									relieve you of your obligations under these Terms or other
									agreements generated on our Platforms. 5.2 If you find that a
									third person fraudulently misappropriated or misappropriated
									your user account and password, or any other circumstances
									that are not legally authorized, you should immediately notify
									our Platforms in an effective manner, requesting our Platforms
									to suspend the related services. All the liabilities, losses,
									damages, claims, costs or expenses arising from or in
									connection with use of your account, whether authorized or
									unauthorized, shall be borne by you. 5.3 In view of the
									particularity of the network service, you agree that our
									Platforms have the right to change, discontinue or terminate
									some or all of the network services at any time without prior
									notification nor any liability whatsoever to you or any third
									party. 5.4 You understand that our Platforms need to be
									repaired or maintained on a platform that provides network
									services (such as Internet sites, mobile networks, etc.) or
									related equipment on a regular or irregular basis. If such a
									situation causes the network service to be interrupted within
									a reasonable period of time, our Platforms shall provide
									notice as soon as practicable but shall not be responsible for
									any loss, damage, claim or liability otherwise arising
									therefrom. 5.5 Our Platforms have the right to stop, suspend
									or terminate all or part of the services under these Terms
									without notice, to take any mitigation or interlocutory
									measures (including without limitation to canceling or
									reversing transactions and freezing accounts), and to remove
									or delete the registration data, at our sole discretion
									without any liability whatsoever to you or any third party.
									Without prejudice to the generality of the above, we may seek
									to enforce our right in the following scenarios: （1）Our
									Platforms believe that the personal data you provide is not
									authentic, valid or complete; （2）Our Platforms discover or
									suspect an abnormal or illegal transaction or unusual
									activities on your part; （3）Our Platforms consider that your
									account is suspected of money laundering, cashing, pyramid
									schemes, fraudulent use or other situations that our Platforms
									consider to be risky; （4）Our Platforms believe that you have
									violated these Terms; （5）If you use the fee-based network
									service, you do not pay the corresponding service fee to our
									Platforms as required; （6）We detect unauthorized access to
									your account, or your account is subject to a governmental
									proceeding, criminal/regulatory investigation or any pending
									litigation; （7）Other circumstances in which at our
									Platforms’ sole discretion, it is necessary to suspend,
									interrupt or terminate all or part of the services under these
									Terms and remove or delete the registration data. 5.6 You
									agree that the suspension, interruption or termination of your
									account or any other measures taken by us pursuant to the
									preceding clause does not release you from your liability, and
									you shall be liable for possible breach of contract or damages
									or any other cause of action during your use of the Platform's
									services, and our Platforms may retain your information. 5.7
									If the account of the free network service you registered is
									not actually used for any consecutive 90 days, our Platforms
